Yitu Wang is a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering in Duke ECE Department under the supervision of [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen). He received B.S.E. in Microelectronics from Fudan University in 2020. His research interests focus on computer architecture, including machine learning acceleration, near data processing for data-intensive applications such recommendation system, approximate nearest neighbor search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for LLM, and algorithm-architecture co-design for deep learning system.
